## How the Game Works

The game begins in the year 1957, during the dawn of the space age. At first, the sky is peaceful and quiet. 

Starting from 1961, space debris begins to appear and fall from the top of the screen. You must dodge the garbage using your spaceship — if you collide with it, the game is over.

In the year 2020, a new feature is unlocked: you gain access to a plasma gun that allows you to shoot down the space garbage.
